              on September 29, 2005. After living in Korea for nearly the
              entirety of my parent's lives, they decided to move to the States
              in pursuit of my father's PhD in computer science. As a child of
              Asian immigrants, it was difficult for me to connect to the people
              around me since Korean culture barely had any presence in Texas at
              the time. This issue was quickly fixed, however, when my family
              moved to San Diego, California, when a job opportunity opened up
              for my father. Ever since then, we have been happily living in San
              Diego for over a decade.

            <h3>The Beginnings of a Chargers Fan</h3>
            <p>
              When I was around nine years old, I watched

              </a>
              where Peyton Manning and Von Miller led the Denver Broncos to the
              Lombardi Trophy, winning 24-10 against the Carolina Panthers.
              Although nine-year-old me knew what American Football was, this
              was the first time I ever watched a real game. Instantly, I fell
              in love with the game and luckily, there was a team waiting for me
              to cheer for: The San Diego Chargers. I watched Philip Rivers lead
              his team to one of the top offenses in the league, but also sadly
              sexperienced the Chargers move to the City of Angels. Nowadays, I
              am still a proud Chargers fan where hopefully one day I will be
              able to see them lift the Lombardi Trophy.

            <h3>Future</h3>
            <p>
              I would say that most people do not know what their future careers
              are going to be. I myself had the same problem where I first
              wanted to be a firefighter which then swapped to a doctor, and
              finally a psychiatrist. As of today, however, I have committed
              myself to follow in the footsteps of my father in becoming a
              software engineer. Although I was not a prodigy at coding nor
              disassembled machines as a child, the exponential growth of modern
              technology has drawn me into this field. I hope that one day I
              will be able to work for a game company, but after recent news of
              the
